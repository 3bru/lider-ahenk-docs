**Client Login Settings**

With the client login settings add-on, 2 types of tasks can be sent for the machine taken to the domain. It can cancel the login settings of the machine imported from LDAP or Active Directory to the domain. The machines that are taken to the domain via LDAP can log into Active Directory or the machines that are taken to the domain with Active Directory can log in via LDAP.
